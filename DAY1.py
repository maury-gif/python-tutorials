March 13th 2025
I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so i can do this from my phone wherever i happen to be. 
No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling excited, challenged and ready""")
